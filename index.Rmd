# Preface {-}

This book accompanies the "Survey Research Datasets and R" workshop delivered for the [7th Biennial ACSPRI Social Science Methodology Conference](https://conferences.acspri.org.au/2020/). Many thanks to ACSPRI for having us, and to the workshop attendees for participating.

The R packages covered in this book are the result of uncountable hours of hard work by the R community, and all are freely available and released under open source licenses. The work we do would not be possible without them!

#### Datasets {-}

We chose to use a real life survey dataset for demonstration purposes. The majority of examples throughout use data from NORC at the University of Chicago's 2018 [General Society Survey](http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data).^[Smith, Tom W, Peter Marsden, Michael Hout, and Jibum Kim. General Social Surveys, 1972-2014]

The online data examples use publicly available data from the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, the Australian [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au) and the [Queensland Government](https://www.data.qld.gov.au).

A very heartfelt thankyou to the people and organisations advocating for open data release and doing the work to make this data publicly available.
